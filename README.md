🏡 House Price Prediction Model Using Regression 📊
🔹 Overview
The House Price Prediction Model is a Machine Learning (ML) project that uses Regression Analysis to estimate the price of a house based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and location 🏠💰.
🔹 How It Works
1️⃣ Data Collection 📊 → Gather past house sales data, including prices and features.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing 🛠️ → Clean, normalize, and format the dataset for training.
3️⃣ Model Training 🎯 → Apply Linear Regression to learn patterns in pricing.
4️⃣ Predictions 🤖 → Input house details to get an estimated market price.
5️⃣ Fine-Tuning & Validation ✅ → Improve accuracy using feature engineering, scaling, and optimization.
🔹 Why This Project Matters?
🏡 Helps Buyers & Sellers → Predict house prices before buying or listing properties!
📈 Real Estate Insights → Supports agents & investors in making data-driven decisions.
💰 Better Financial Planning → Assists banks in mortgage approval processes.
🌍 Urban Development Support → Helps developers estimate affordability in growing cities.
🔹 Features
