House Price Prediction using Linear Regression (From Scratch)
Overview
This project builds a Linear Regression model from scratch to predict house prices based on three factors:
- Square footage (size of the house)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
The model learns from past housing data and predicts the price for new houses based on user input.
Installation & Setup
Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Pickle

Installation
- Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <your-repo-name>
- Install dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
- Ensure your dataset (house_data.csv) is in the same directory as the script.

Dataset
The dataset (house_data.csv) should contain house details with columns like:
square_footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, price
1400, 3, 2, 250000
1800, 4, 3, 320000


Each row represents a house, and the model learns from this data.

Project Workflow
Step 1: Load the Dataset
- Read the dataset using Pandas:
df = pd.read_csv("./house_data.csv")


Step 2: Prepare the Features & Target Variable
- Extract relevant columns:
X = df[['square_footage', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms']].values
y = df['price'].values
- Remove extra spaces (if needed):
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()


Step 3: Normalize the Features
- Scale the data to ensure fair learning:
X = (X - X.mean(axis=0)) / X.std(axis=0)


Step 4: Define the Linear Regression Model
- Implement Linear Regression from scratch using Python:
class LinearRegressionScratch:
     def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, epochs=1000):
         self.lr = learning_rate
         self.epochs = epochs
         self.weights = None
         self.bias = 0


Step 5: Train the Model using Gradient Descent
- Adjust weights (w1, w2, w3) iteratively:
for _ in range(self.epochs):
     y_predicted = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
     error = y_predicted - y

     dw = (1 / n_samples) * np.dot(X.T, error)
     db = (1 / n_samples) * np.sum(error)

     self.weights -= self.lr * dw
     self.bias -= self.lr * db


Step 6: Make Predictions
- Predict house prices using:
def predict(self, X):
     return np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias


Step 7: Visualize the Predictions
- Compare actual vs predicted prices:
plt.scatter(y, y_pred, alpha=0.6, color='blue', label='Predicted vs Actual')
plt.plot([min(y), max(y)], [min(y), max(y)], '--', color='red', label='Perfect Fit')

plt.xlabel('Actual Prices')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Prices')
plt.title('Actual vs Predicted House Prices')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

Step 8: Save the Model for Future Use
- Store the trained model using pickle:
with open('linear_regression_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
     pickle.dump(model, file)


Step 9: User Input for Price Prediction
- Take inputs from the user:
try:
     square_footage = float(input("Enter square footage of the house: "))
     bedrooms = int(input("Enter number of bedrooms: "))
     bathrooms = int(input("Enter number of bathrooms: "))
except ValueError:
     print("❌ Invalid input! Please enter numeric values.")
     exit()
- Normalize new inputs:
new_data = np.array([[square_footage, bedrooms, bathrooms]])
new_data = (new_data - X.mean(axis=0)) / X.std(axis=0)
- Predict house price:
predicted_price = model.predict(new_data)



Future Improvements
Some ways to improve this project:
- Use Scikit-Learn for better model handling.
- Add more features (location, construction year, amenities).
- Build a Web UI for user-friendly interaction.
